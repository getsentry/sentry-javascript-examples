# Example Apps for the Sentry JS SDKs

_This repository is a work in progress_

The main purpose of this repository is to visualize the differences between the
[Sentry JS SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) version 7 and version 8. Those
example applications can also be used as a reference for using the JS SDKs.
